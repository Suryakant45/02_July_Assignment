    "Ans:- In object-oriented programming (OOP), inheritance is a fundamental concept that allows one class to inherit properties and behaviers(i.e, attributes and method) from another class. The class that inherits from another is called the \"Subclass \" or \"derived class \" while the class from which it inherits is called the \"superclass\" or \"baseclass\"    \n",
